Christmas is coming. The river stole the gods. Hurry! I really want to go to work, but I am too sick to drive. He turned in the research paper on Friday; otherwise, he would have not passed the class. Mary plays the piano. The memory we used to share is no longer coherent. If you like tuna and tomato sauce- try combining the two. It’s really not as bad as it sounds. He told us a very exciting adventure story. Wow, does that work? He said he was not there yesterday; however, many people saw him there. The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight. Malls are great places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof. I am counting my calories, yet I really want dessert. I will never be this young again. Ever. Oh damn… I just got older. I am never at home on Sundays. I hear that Nancy is very pretty. He ran out of money, so he had to stop playing poker. Writing a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would be. Sometimes, all you need to do is completely make an ass of yourself and laugh it off to realise that life isn’t so bad after all.
